# BlogApp

YelpCamp is a project that you can Create , Read , Update and Delete Blogs . My version contains also a part that you can add a comments for each blog . 

This version uses Semantic UI as a css libary and PassportJS for authentication 

# Setup 

Different setups are needed if you plan on using BlogApp locally : 
1 - Installing NodeJS 
2 - Installing MongoDB 
3 - Install NodeModules Like express , mongoose , body-parser .... ( you can find them in the package.json file )
